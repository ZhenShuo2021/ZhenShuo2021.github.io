Searching for information online is often a pain in the ass. You run into all sorts of crap: long-winded intros full of fluff, irrelevant memes, incorrect info, content scattered across different sites, pop-up ads, login walls, paywalls, slow loading times, spam sites, disabled right-clicks, and copy restrictions. Fed up with this nonsense, I decided to make my own blog as a personal knowledge base. The key feature of this blog is:

<center><h2> No BS, Just the Good Stuff </h2></center>

Of course, this mainly applies to technical articles.

Besides that, there'll be some random musings too. That's pretty much the gist of it.
